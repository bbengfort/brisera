# Fixtures

The fixtures directory holds reference sequences and other data used to test and build the project. These data sets are too large to store on Github (most of them are larger than 1 MB, and Github has a 100MB maximum). Therefore we host the data files on S3. To get access to the data files contact Tony or Ben at District Data Labs.
